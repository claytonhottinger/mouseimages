## Description
This is a Chrome extension takes Sarah Fox's [mouse sparkle code pen](https://codepen.io/sarahwfox/pen/pNrYGb) and replaces the 'sparkles' with images (currently my face).

## Customization
Future functionality will include a UI to change the image that is used. Until then, you can replace 'image.png' with whatever image you'd like. Just make sure to make sure your replacement is named 'image.png'.

## Running in Chrome
Go to Chrome's [extension page](chrome://extensions). In the top right corner you can activate 'Developer Mode'. Once in Developer Mode you can either load the unpacked extension from the source folder, or pack the extension for easier sharing.
